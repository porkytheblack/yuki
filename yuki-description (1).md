## Your Little Helper for Finances

## What is Yuki?

Yuki is a personal finance tracker that meets you where you are—not where spreadsheets wish you were.

Unlike conventional budgeting apps that demand manual entry, bank connections, and rigid categorization, Yuki accepts the mess. PDFs, CSVs, photos of receipts, or just your words. She takes what you give her and makes sense of it.

## Philosophy

**"Bring me the chaos."**

Financial tracking fails when it asks too much of you. Most tools expect you to become an accountant just to understand where your money goes. Yuki inverts this. You hand her your documents, your receipts, your half-remembered expenses—and she does the organizing.

Yuki is the assistant who sorts through the shoebox of receipts so you don't have to.

## How Yuki Works

### Upload Phase — Yuki Accepts Everything

Yuki handles whatever you throw at her:

- **PDFs** — Bank statements, invoices, bills
- **CSVs** — Exports from your bank or other apps
- **Images** — Photos of receipts, screenshots of transactions
- **Plain text** — "Spent $23 on lunch yesterday" works just fine

No formatting requirements. No templates. Just upload and let Yuki figure it out.

### Processing Phase — Yuki Organizes

Once Yuki receives your documents, she extracts the data, categorizes transactions, and builds a picture of your spending. She tracks:

- **Where your money goes** — Categories, merchants, patterns
- **When you spend** — Daily, weekly, monthly trends
- **How you spend** — Recurring vs. one-time, necessities vs. discretionary

Over time, Yuki learns your habits and gets smarter about organizing your finances.

### Insight Phase — Yuki Reports

Ask Yuki anything about your money:

- "What did I spend the most on this month?"
- "Show me a graph of my food expenses"
- "How much have I spent on subscriptions this year?"
- "Am I on track for my savings goal?"

Yuki answers with clear visuals and plain language—not accounting jargon.

### Advisory Phase — Yuki Suggests

When you want guidance, Yuki offers it gently:

- Areas where you might cut back
- Spending patterns you may not have noticed
- Progress toward your savings targets
- Simple, actionable advice—never guilt

Yuki observes, but only speaks up when asked.

## Weekly Wrapped

Every week, Yuki prepares a short presentation just for you.

**Five minutes. Your money. What happened.**

- Summary of the week's spending
- Notable transactions or patterns
- Progress on savings goals
- Reminders for upcoming bills or deadlines
- Nudges to upload any missing documents

Yuki also keeps an eye on the calendar. Tax season approaching? She'll remind you. Documents overdue? She'll ask nicely.

The weekly wrapped gives Yuki a heartbeat—a regular moment where she shows up, reports in, and keeps you informed without you having to dig through dashboards.

---

## What Yuki Is Not

**Not a bank connection tool.** Yuki doesn't need access to your accounts—she works with what you give her.

**Not a manual entry app.** You don't need to log every coffee. Just upload a receipt or tell her later.

**Not a guilt machine.** Yuki doesn't judge your spending or shame you into saving. She informs.

**Not a replacement for financial advice.** Yuki helps you see clearly, but she's not a financial advisor.

## Who Yuki Is For

- People with finances scattered across formats and accounts
- Anyone who's abandoned budgeting apps because they're too demanding
- Freelancers and contractors juggling invoices and receipts
- People who want awareness of their spending without obsessing over it
- Anyone who just wants a clear answer to "where did my money go?"

## The Yuki Experience

You open Yuki. You drag in a bank statement PDF and three photos of receipts from your phone.

Yuki processes them quietly. A minute later, your transactions appear—categorized, dated, organized.

You ask: "What did I spend on eating out this month?"

A chart appears. $847. More than you thought.

You ask: "What should I cut back on?"

Yuki highlights your subscription services—three you forgot you had. She doesn't lecture. Just shows you.

Sunday morning, a notification. Yuki's weekly wrapped is ready. You skim it over coffee. Five minutes. You know exactly where you stand.

You close Yuki. She'll be there next week.

## Summary

Yuki is a finance tracker that accepts the mess of real life and turns it into clarity. Upload anything, ask anything, and let Yuki handle the organizing. She shows up once a week with a short report, keeps you informed about what matters, and never asks you to become someone you're not. Your finances, finally making sense.
